# Week 3: RBAC To the Future & Calico Networking

## RBAC Project Notes:

## Configuring the users for the startup of the minikube instance:

Running `kubectl config view` logs this:

```

To then set up the `intern.yml` file, I created the following:
- I separated the API Groups so that "pods" belongs to the core API group which is "", while "deployments" belongs to the "apps" API group.
- This way, each resource is separate and correctly associated within its API group.
- For the rolebindings for the the subjects, I am specifying specific rules for "Jules" (one person), then defining permissions for the Role named "Intern", and then I assign those permissions to the user "Jules" through RoleBinding.

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: Intern
  namespace: dev
rules:
# TODO:
# target pods with verbs get, watch, list
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: InternBinding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
# TODO: add Jules as target user
# note: this is case sensitive
- kind: User
  name: "Jules"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
# TODO: add target role to Intern
  kind: Role
  name: Intern
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

After saving changes, I ran this command: `kubectl apply -f ./roles/intern.yml`

This printed out:
```bash
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/Intern unchanged
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/InternBinding created
```


### üêû Debugging: 
There was an error where I had this below, and it errored because of the -. The `roleRef` in a `roleBinding` (or `ClusterRoleBinding`) can only reference one single, specific role, and cannot be an array. So that's why this won't work:
```bash
roleRef:
- kind: Role
  name: Intern
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

But this will:
```bash
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: Intern
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
